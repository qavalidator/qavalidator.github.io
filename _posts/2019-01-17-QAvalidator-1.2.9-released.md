Today, QAvalidator 1.2.9 was released. See the [Release Notes](https://qavalidator.github.io/static/doc/qav-doc.html#release-notes) for details.

Exciting news: We started to combine static an dynamic analysis, and we added support to export the analysis result to Neo4j. Both is work in progress, so we look forward to feedback from the community.
