Today, QAvalidator 1.2.11 was released. See the [Release Notes](https://qavalidator.github.io/static/doc/qav-doc.html#release-notes) for details.

Cool new feature: The Web UI shows all graph images which were created in an analysis run. Viewing the SVG images even allows to navigate directly from the graph to the detail view of the component.
